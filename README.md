# A _bit_ of history

AresRPG first came up to the world in 2013 under the name EclozionMMORPG
from the idea of [@StoneBloodTV](https://github.com/jdathueyt) and [@Sceat](https://github.com/Sceat), later on the team splitted due to
an internal lack of organization and **AresRPG** as you know it flew on its own.

Fully written in Java by [@DarkPingoo](https://github.com/DarkPingoo) and [@Sceat](https://github.com/Sceat), the project released a test version
called [the tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29AIkBtScgQ), quite successful and enjoyed by the community it
kept going, the team grew bigger with [@DeltaEvo](https://github.com/DeltaEvo), [@unixfox](https://github.com/unixfox) and many more that you
can still find in the community these days.

## The `v1`

The [gameplay was quite simple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4xb67Z5dxY), find mobs and kill them, buy the stuff rince and repeat.

4 classes were available:

- Barbarian
- Archer
- Vampire
- Mage

There was duels, exchanges, spells, skill points, teleportation stone, boss fights
team loot, etc..

The world was working though a floor system,
when you complete a floor you go to the next one.
This version made AresRPG [quite famous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEELCqYUyEI)

## The `v2`

The V2 is [an unreleased version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkzGcEcBP1Q) of AresRPG,
the goal of this version was to have a procedural open-world instead
of a floor system and more classes than the v1, with an overall gameplay upgrade.
